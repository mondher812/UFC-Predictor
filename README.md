## FightSight

## Overview
FightSight is a Machine Learning Combat Sport Predictor project which aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict outcomes in combat sports. By analyzing historical fight data, the model provides insights into potential fight results, enhancing strategic decision-making for fighters and coaches.

## Key Contributions
- **Data Preparation**: Merged two comprehensive fight datasets to create a robust dataset of over **1,000 entries**, laying the foundation for accurate predictions.
- **Model Optimization**: Experimented with multiple classifiers, including KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and MLPClassifier. Utilized GridSearchCV for precise hyperparameter tuning, achieving a notable **74% accuracy**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to visualize correlations and trends, guiding the refinement of predictive models and enhancing understanding of the data.
- **Fairness and Accuracy**: Addressed input bias and normalized feature scales to ensure robust and equitable model predictions, prioritizing fairness in outcomes.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enhanced model performance through iterative feature refinement and parameter tuning, meticulously documenting decisions for reproducibility and future improvements.
